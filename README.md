# Clean-Data-Course-Project
Course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

As per the instructions there is only one script for this assignment.

run_analysis.R does the complete analysis and creates the file Tidy_Data_Set.csv


NOTE  : This script uses the dplyr package so this needs to be installed prior to running
